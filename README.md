# supply-chain-digital-twin-demo
This project builds a synthetic digital twin of a retail supply chain network, inspired by real-world network strategy work. It simulates the annual refresh process that large retailers (like Home Depot, Walmart, Loweâ€™s, and Amazon) use to guide long-range supply chain investments.
